This read me contains various project about recursion function:
1. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line
2. a function that prints a string in reverse.
3. a function that returns the length of a string
4. a function that returns the factorial of a given number
5. a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y
6. a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
7. a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
